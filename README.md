# rUNSWift-Manual

Repository for maintaining the Sphinx Documentation for rUNSWift.
**Currently under trial**

To compile locally, run `make html`. 
The home documentation page can be opened by opening `build/html/index.html` in a browser.


## CI
The gh-pages branch is automatically generated by Travis-CI, whenever a push to the master branch happens. It contains the built html files.
This is then uploaded to https://unswcomputing.github.io/rUNSWift-Manual/

The instructions for setting up the CI were here:
