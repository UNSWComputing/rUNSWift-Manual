Building

To compile (build) the codebase for a V6 robot, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ nao_build-2.8.sh

.. note::
    By default, the maximum number of processors available will be used for compilation.


.. tip::
    Builds can fail in strange ways sometimes. Try ``nao_build-2.8.sh -B`` to do a clean build
